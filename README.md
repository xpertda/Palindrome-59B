Palindrome Partitioning Visualizer using Dynamic Programming (C++)

This project is a terminal-based visualization tool that demonstrates how to partition a string into the minimum number of palindromic substrings using Dynamic Programming
It provides a live step-by-step animation of the palindrome table to help understand the internal logic behind the algorithm.


-  Real-time visualization of palindrome substring detection.
-  Uses Dynamic Programming for efficient computation.
- Animated 2D table to represent palindrome truth values.
-  Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).
-  Perfect for educational and demonstrative purposes.
